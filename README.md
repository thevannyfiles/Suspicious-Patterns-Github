# Suspicious-Patterns-Github

<b>Description:</b> The "Finding Suspicious Patterns in GitHub Accounts" project tackles the important task of identifying potentially suspicious or robot-generated accounts within the GitHub ecosystem. By analyzing a dataset that includes the logs of accounts created on a single day, the project aims to flag accounts exhibiting behaviors that are indicative of automated or coordinated mass creation.

### Key Objectives:

1. <b>Suspicious Account Detection:</b> The primary objective of this project is to employ data analysis techniques to flag GitHub accounts that exhibit patterns suggestive of automated or coordinated creation. These patterns may include rapid, repetitive account generation that could indicate the involvement of a single actor or a small group of actors.

2. <b>Campaign Development:</b> To achieve this goal, a campaign was designed and implemented to systematically detect and flag suspicious accounts. This campaign leverages a combination of data analysis methods and statistical approaches to identify outliers and anomalies.

### Tools Used:

1. <b>Excel:</b> Excel serves as the foundational tool for data preprocessing, cleaning, and organization. It allows for the initial exploration of the dataset, providing valuable insights into the nature of the accounts.

2. <b>PowerPoint:</b> PowerPoint is used to create presentations that effectively communicate the project's findings. It plays a vital role in visually presenting the data-driven narratives and insights.

3. <b>R:</b> R, a powerful statistical programming language, is the analytical backbone of the project. It enables advanced data analysis, outlier detection, and the development of statistical models to identify suspicious patterns.

This project serves as a testament to the creator's proficiency in data analysis and problem-solving. It addresses an important issue in the realm of online platforms and user account management, demonstrating the potential for data-driven approaches to enhance platform security and integrity.

By exploring the visualizations and analyses presented in this project, one can gain valuable insights into the methodologies and strategies employed to detect and flag suspicious accounts on GitHub. It underscores the importance of data analysis in identifying and mitigating potential security threats in the digital age.
